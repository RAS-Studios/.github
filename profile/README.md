# 🎮 RAS Studios — README

Welcome to **RAS Studios**, a small independent game studio fueled by creativity, stubbornness, and an unhealthy amount of energy drinks.

We’re a team of developers who love building experiences that are fun, polished, and sometimes way more ambitious than they need to be.
Our motto?
“If nothing works, at least it looks cool.”

### 🚀 Who We Are

RAS Studios is a VR-focused and gameplay-driven game studio.
We design, prototype, break things, fix them, and then pretend it was all part of the plan.

We like:

- Clean interactions
- Satisfying physics
- Games that actually feel good to play
- Joking about deadlines we’re definitely not going to meet

We don’t like:

- Overcomplicated design documents
- Poor audio feedback
- Players who discover bugs we didn’t notice

---

### 🕹️ Current Projects
🏓 **Pong Panic VR**

Our main project: a dynamic VR ping-pong-inspired game with:

- Full VR interactions
- Assistive gameplay (because your VR swing isn’t always… accurate)
- Polished physics
- A social lobby with music, arcade machines, cosmetic systems, and more

Think “Wii Sports table tennis,” but reborn in VR with modern physics and just enough chaos.

### 🔧 Tech & Tools

- Unity (we fight it daily)
- C# (we fight it too)
- Blender (we’re getting better)
- Git (we hope you never see our commit history...   -Alexandre)

### 🤝 Why We Make Games

We love gameplay that feels fun first, with interactions that make people smile, curse, or laugh like idiots.
If a player says, “Wait… do that again!” — that’s a win for us.
